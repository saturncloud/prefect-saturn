# todo

Temporary tracker for TODOs. This file should be removed before releasing the library.

* should deployment tokens be stored in a secret instead of in the storage object? (probably)
* test that KubernetesJobEnvironment can support concurrent runs (does it add randomness to names?)
* use a `nodeSelector` in `add_environment()` to be sure jobs run on the right type of node in EKS
* validating names: https://app.clickup.com/t/8umcwn
*
